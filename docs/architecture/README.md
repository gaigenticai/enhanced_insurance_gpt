# Insurance AI Agent System - Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The Insurance AI Agent System is a comprehensive, production-ready platform designed to automate and enhance insurance operations through artificial intelligence. The system follows a microservices architecture with event-driven communication, ensuring scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Microservices Architecture
- **Service Decomposition**: Each business domain (policies, claims, documents, evidence) is implemented as an independent service
- **API Gateway**: Centralized entry point for all client requests with authentication, rate limiting, and routing
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic service registration and discovery for dynamic scaling
- **Circuit Breakers**: Fault tolerance and resilience patterns to prevent cascade failures

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Services communicate through events and message queues
- **Event Sourcing**: Complete audit trail of all system changes
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separate read and write models for optimal performance
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transaction management across services

### 3. AI-First Design
- **AI Agent Framework**: Pluggable AI agents for different business functions
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Continuous model training and deployment
- **Real-time Processing**: Stream processing for immediate AI insights
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Seamless integration of human oversight and AI automation
